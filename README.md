Gesture control using ultrasonic sensors

![alt text](https://github.com/anirudha-bs/Gesture-recognition/blob/master/gesture.jpg?raw=true)

Components required - Arduino Uno  , 2 ultrasonic sensors , jumper cables
We are mapping distances recorded by two ultrasonic sensors and sending mesaages to the serial monitor and we are reading the same message in the python script using serial module to programmatically control keyboard and mouse. It can be customized to support any type of gestures.

Install requirements and run the script to start using.

Gestures -

1. Hold two hands at equidistance in front the sensors to pause or play a video.
2. Hold right hand from a distance of the right sensor and move left hand forward and backward to zoom in and zoom out.
3. Hold left hand from a distance of the left sensor and move right hand forward and backward to scroll up and scroll down.
